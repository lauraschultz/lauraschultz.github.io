Pathetic, I know, but I guess this is what ends up happening when the majority of your 20’s have been spent under covid lockdowns.</p>\n<p>I have a somewhat-unruly earring collection and most of them are stored in cardboard sheets that I punched holes into with a sewing needle. I thought I could make a holder for them by laser cutting small holes into a thin plywood sheet for the earrings themselves, and then making a structure underneath to support it, along with a small drawer that I could use to store the earring backs and broken or mismatched earrings. What I ended up designing looked like this:</p>\n<p>It’s so tiny that I ended up cutting it out using only scrap plywood that I had left over from other projects. It took a bit of trial and error to get the correct hole size for the earring backs on the top panel.
